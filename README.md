# Emotion-Recognition-Software

This emotion recognition software is designed to assist individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in understanding emotions and social cues. By analyzing facial expressions in real-time, the software helps users interpret the emotions of others, enhancing their social interactions and communication skills.

## Features

- Real-time emotion recognition from live video streams.
- Support for a wide range of emotions including happiness, sadness, surprise, and more.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Customizable feedback options to suit individual needs.

## Implementation Steps:

- **Data Collection**: We gathered hundreds of images representing a range of emotions, including happiness, sadness, and surprise, from online databases and AI-generated sources.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using OpenCV and custom scripts, we extracted facial landmarks and other relevant features from the images, which serve as inputs for our machine-learning models.
- **Model Training**: We utilized the Scikit-Learn library to train our facial expression recognition model, focusing on optimizing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Integration and Real-Time Processing**: The trained model was integrated with real-time video processing capabilities using the OpenCV library. This setup allows the software to analyze video streams from a computerâ€™s webcam, identify facial expressions frame by frame, and provide immediate feedback to the user.
